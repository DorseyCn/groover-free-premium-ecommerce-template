# Vendors-Extensions

If you have to override a section of any vendor, then `Vendors-extensions/` in which you may have files named exactly after the vendors they overwrite. For instance, `vendors-extensions/_bootstrap.scss` is a file containing all CSS rules intended to re-declare some of Bootstrapâ€™s default CSS. This is to avoid editing the vendor files themselves, which is generally not a good idea.

#### All File
The all file (usually labelled `all.scss`) is just typical import file that contains all code base of the directory.
